# ChatBot

**Project ChatBot by friz666**
The ChatBot project is an amateur project that aims to create a fully functioning bot that, at a basic level, will be able to communicate with the user.

The activities that are required to complete the above project have been broken down and divided into different categories:
  **->** Recognition of the situation, learning about the PyCharm environment, libraries related to the project, tutorials and tutorials that will directly          affect the achievement of progress in the project

  **->** The creation of a file, which is the basis of communication with our bot, In the file with the extension .json will be the various spheres of              communication and their listed patterns and responses. It is from these patterns that the program will learn and recognize potential questions and          adjust the answers accordingly

  **->** Loading the above data and training it into the program through the TensorFlow and WordLemmetaizer libraries. This step will require loading the            training data, preparing them for training, building the primary neural network, and as a consequence of the above actions, training the bot, by, for      example, expanding the pattern resource.

  **->** Building the bot itself, which, through the above data and the neural network, will be able, at a basic level, to communicate with the user

  **->** Setting up the site and creating a simple front-end, which will allow more pleasant use of the bot 

The above list of steps shows the exact plan that will make the project possible and meet its fundamental objectives.
